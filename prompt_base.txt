Next month budget:
Food=#fff#
Grocery=#ggg#
Utilities=#uuu#
Rent=#rrr#
Mobile=#mmm#
Social activities=#sss#


Based on the next month's budget and given analysis of the statement in JSON, create a fun challenge to earn XP for each $5 saved.
Infer yourself on what categories the user can save and limit the challenge response text to 50 words or fewer.
Remember that user cannot be able to make adjustments with Rent and Mobile category. It turns out that you
can also suggest challenges that will save on other categories to support financing of Rent and Mobile categories.
The challenge should not combine more than two activities. If you do so, the user might get a burden and won't
understand the goal. The challenge can also include distributing expenses among categories to stay within budget.
Based on your knowledge and information from the keywords, day-wise expenses, category-wise expenses,
suggest smart saving hints or tips. If you provide examples, it will be better and easy to understand.
Response format should be JSON which has title, first challenge as key and its corresponding challenge text as value and so on. Only two challenges per JSON in following format:
{
"title":<challenge title>,
"challenge1_text":<challenge 1 text>,
"challenge1_hints": <challenge 1 hints>,
"challenge2_text":<challenge 2 text>,
"challenge2_hints": <challenge 2 hints>,
}
